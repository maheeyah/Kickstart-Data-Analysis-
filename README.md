## Overview of Project

### Purpose

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
    The graph shows in May there is an increase tick is successful launch dates slowly decreases by August. With asmall uptick in October and going back down. Failed Launch dates tend to hover around 35% to 55%. Canceled launch dates tend to be low all year around with none in the month of October. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
    I was not able to get my graph to look like the one in the instructions. The correct graph shows two lines that are mirrored because they are reflecting the percentages of successful and percentages of failed outcomes. The graph shows that although seemingly with no pattern the percentage of successful projects decrease as the goal increases in price and vice versa, with percentage of failed projects increase as the goal price increases. 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
    I encountered a Challenge when it came to Deliverable 2 and getting the values for Column C and because of that I wasn't able to get Column E Total Projects, Column G Percentage Failed. Therefore my graph was not correct. After spending over an two hours on AskBCS Learning Assistant I was unfortunately not able to solve this issue. I am looking forward to getting this graded so I am able to go to a tutor and figure out this issue and to be able to resubmit the assignment with full understanding of this KickStarter project. 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
